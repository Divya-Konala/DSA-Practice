Given an array arr[] and an integer K, the task is to reverse every subarray formed by consecutive K elements.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], K = 3 
Output: 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], K = 5 
Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6


Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], K = 1 
Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], K = 10 
Output: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
