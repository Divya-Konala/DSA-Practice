## URL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/
Given an array of N non-negative integers arr[] representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = {2, 0, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: The structure is like below.
We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.


Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 2, 0, 4}
Output: 7
Explanation: Structure is like below.
We can trap “3 units” of water between 3 and 2,
“1 unit” on top of bar 2 and “3 units” between 2 and 4.
