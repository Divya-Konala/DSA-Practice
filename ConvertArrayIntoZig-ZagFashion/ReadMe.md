## URL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-array-into-zig-zag-fashion/

Given an array of distinct elements of size N, the task is to rearrange the elements of the array in a zig-zag fashion so that the converted array should be in the below form: 

arr[0] < arr[1]  > arr[2] < arr[3] > arr[4] < . . . . arr[n-2] < arr[n-1] > arr[n]. 

Examples:

Input: N = 7 , arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1} 
Output: arr[] = {3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1}
Explanation: The given array is in zig-zag pattern as we can see 3 < 7 > 4 < 8 > 2 < 6 >1

Input: N = 4 , arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2} 
Output: arr[] = {1, 4, 2, 3}
Explanation: The given array is in zig-zag pattern as we can see 1 < 4 > 2 < 3
